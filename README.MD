# gatsby-starter-carraway

A gatsbyJS theme

## Features
- TypeScript all the things
- Some sensible TypeScript defaults
- Tests with @testing-library/react
- Pre-commit and pre-push hooks to check the above before you make an idiot of yourself
- Setup for a CircleCI pipeline so you can run the above tests in branches before merging to master 
- Some _basic_ UI elements that I commonly use for layout
- Features some enums for repeating values such as font & background colours
- UI elements include a rudimentary header and footer with nav menus
- Basic GraphQL queries assuming a Markdown data source for the above components

## Contributions welcome!
